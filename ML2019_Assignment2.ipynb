The dominant Android operating system gains approximately 80% market shares worldwide, and most apps are housed in the Google Play Store, which reflects that the Google Play Store is the biggest and famous app stores. Therefore, how to develop an app that can attract more android users are crucial for all app developers to consider. This paper focuses on predicting the apps' rating data and figure out how the rating data have been influenced by other attributes, which will assist developers to get an insight of app's details and make more wise decisions when developing an app. \n",

To figure out the rating data, first, the dataset features are analyzing by using data visualization tools, such as pie chart and histogram. Then based on the understanding of whole dataset shape, the KNN and Random Forest algorithms are applied to do the modeling, and the results are compared in the evaluation section.\n",

Random forest and K-Nearest Neighbour are the two algorithms that we choose to analysis the data and predict the rating of applications. The result shows that the random forest has a higher accuracy rate. K-Nearest Neighbour is not suitable for large dataset because this kind of algorithm only computes the \"nearest\" neighbor samples. If the number of samples in a class is large, or the samples are not close to the target sample, or such samples are very close to the target sample, then the sample will be an new input and large-capacity class among the K neighbors of the sample will also be the majority. Try different methods that could help us get better predicting results. Besides, this research could be better improved in the future. For example, the attributes correlation could be better examined. This paper use heatmap to visualize the correlation of each attribute. But the result of heatmap could be influenced by the dimensions that we chose. The correlation rates will be various from the dimension.

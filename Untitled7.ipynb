        "Since the mobile devices are invaded into people's daily life now, the number of app users are increased rapidly, which cause the growth of app developers correspondingly. The dominant Android operating system gains approximately 80% market shares worldwide, and most apps are housed in the Google Play Store, which reflects that the Google Play Store is the biggest and famous app stores. Therefore, how to develop an app that can attract more android users are crucial for all app developers to consider. This paper focuses on predicting the apps' rating data and figure out how the rating data have been influenced by other attributes, which will assist developers to get an insight of app's details and make more wise decisions when developing an app. \n",

The data of Each app includes basic information about app price, rating scores, category, etc. There is a total of 13 attributes and 10,841 entries contained in this dataset. To figure out the rating data, first, the dataset features are analyzing by using data visualization tools, such as pie chart and histogram. Then based on the understanding of whole dataset shape, the KNN and Random Forest algorithms are applied to do the modeling, and the results are compared in the evaluation section.\n",
